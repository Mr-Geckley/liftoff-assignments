### Overview
The concept is very simple. I'll be building a tic-tac-toe style game, but with a few enhancements to make the experience novel and engaging. The idea came to when my daughter wanted to play game after game after game after game of tic-tac-toe. We would always run out of space on paper, and as the adult, I was unengaged in the game after repeatedly playing. 

I want the game to be available to everyone - which isn't as simple as just hosting the game on a website. In this day and age we typically assume that everyone has access to reliable internet. However, there is a large rual population for whom internet is prohibitvey expensive. Furthermore, the same percentage of people in the US only have a phone with which to access the internet. Along with a dependcy on phones for internet comes an increased likelihood of having a lower-end device with limited performance and storage capabilities. I recall when my partner and I first started our parenting adventure, our phones were adequate, but the devices scarcely had storage enough to hold the apps we found useful - let alone hold any extra games to play with our little one. 

So the app needs to be available offline, fully responsive, as well as have a small enough file size that it won't have to be a burden on the owner's limited memory availbe to their device.

### Features
User login: The user should be able to have their stat's saved so they can unlock bonus themes.
Game play: In addition to the traditional tic-tac-toe style game play, the user will play with a variety of tokens which represent their "team". This will break up the monoteny of the classic game by forcing the user to evaluate and interperate the board. And upon a winning combination, the winning team will get a neat, appropriatly themed celebration.
Bonus themes: Upon playing "x" amount of games, the user wil have access to additional themes, and eventually be able to pick their own game pieces.
Service worker: The game will be availble to download directly to the users device, allowing an engaging experience regardless of internet connectivity, and without the need to sapp their data.
