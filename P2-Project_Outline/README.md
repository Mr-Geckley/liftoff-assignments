### Overview
I'll be building a tic-tac-toe style game, but with a few enhancements to make the experience novel and engaging, as well accessible to as many people as possible.

The primary design consideration for this project is "offline-first". A shocking number of families, particularly in rural areas, don't have reliable internet connectivity. In addition to this obstacle, many families only means of connecting to the internet is via their mobile phone. And in many cases their phone is a budget model that doesn't have a lot in the way of memory, which places serious restrictions on one's ability to keep non-essential applications on their phone.

The struggle of any parent of any young child is keeping their kid entertained. A classic go-to game for families with young children is tic-tac-toe. The day to day life of parent is difficult enough even without having to fumble with endless scraps of paper and keeping track of the oft-disappearing ink pen. Peck-Scratch-Go is a simple solution that will make otherwise painful moments of boredom more simple and enjoyable for everybody involved.

### Features
User login: The user should be able to have their stats saved so they can unlock bonus themes.

Game play: In addition to the traditional tic-tac-toe style game play, the user will play with a variety of tokens which represent their "team". This will break up the monotony of the classic game by forcing the user to evaluate and interpret the board. And upon a winning combination, the winning team will get a neat, appropriately themed celebration.

Bonus themes: Upon playing "x" amount of games, the user will have access to additional themes, and eventually be able to pick their own game pieces.

Service worker: The game will be available to download directly to the users device, allowing an engaging experience regardless of internet connectivity, and without the need to sapp their data.
